What is PotClassic?
-------------------

The original Potcoin UTXO chain started on January 15th, 2014 - Making it a true crypto pioneer!
PotClassic (POT) is a continuation of the abandoned Proof-of-Stake-Velocity (PoSV) chain of Potcoin (POT).
The original chain transitioned from UTXO / PoSV block generation to tokenized (ERC-20) platform.
As a result, nearly 115 million legacy Potcoins were burn-swapped into ERC-20 POT token.
This caused a complete halt to PoSV activity on the old chain, with >3 months of uncertain future...
In addition, the transition to ERC-20 format prompted various scammers to "replicate" POT token.
By late Summer of 2022, the POT UTXO blockchain was completely abandoned, with zero staking activity :(
This left numerous stakeholders / Potcoin holders / Exchanges / etc., without community support or direction.

Our solution?
-------------

According to the old saying - "Don't fix it if it ain't broken!" - A group of legacy Potcoin enthusiasts
decided to proceed with step-wise restoration of the the chain to fully functional status, in the following stages:

[1] Generation of sufficient UTXOs to allow seamless PoSV block generation again - This stage took >3 months
[2] Restoration of SPV (i.e., ElectrumX) infrastructure that will enable multi-wallet additions for Potcoin
[3] Gradual modernization of Potcoin code, into what will be called PotClassic...

Currently operational infrastructure + Progress:

[1] CryptoID block explorer - This was restored, along with correct labels for burn addresses: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/pot/#
[2] SPV infrastructure - This includes ElectruX server - This is being worked on, and will be added to AtomicDEX when done.

Project updates?
----------------
As we explore various components of PotClassic code, including its current status, we will be updating folks.
Our primary activity will be happening in Legacy Blockchain Discord channel: https://discord.gg/ejbyceYBMd
Once we get more community participation, we may set up a dedicated PotClassic Discord channel... stay tuned!
