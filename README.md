What is PotClassic?
-------------------

PotClassic is a working description of the legacy Potcoin UTXO chain in its original format.
The original Potcoin UTXO chain started on January 15th, 2014 - Making it a true crypto pioneer!
Potcoin (POT) legacy is a continuation of the original Proof-of-Stake-Velocity (PoSV) chain of Potcoin (POT).
The original chain transitioned from UTXO / PoSV block generation to tokenized (ERC-20) platform.
As a result, nearly 115 million legacy Potcoins were burn-swapped into ERC-20 POT token.
This repository represents an independent effort to update / upgrade / funcionalize the legacy UTXO chain.

Our solution?
-------------

According to the old saying - "Don't fix it if it ain't broken!" - A group of legacy Potcoin enthusiasts
initiated a step-wise restoration of the the chain to fully functional status, according to the following plan/stages:

[1] Generation of sufficient UTXOs to allow seamless PoSV block generation again - This stage took >3 months; 
[2] Restoration of SPV (i.e., ElectrumX) infrastructure that will enable multi-wallet additions for Potcoin; and 
[3] Gradual modernization of Potcoin code, with the specific goal of achieving compability with Atomic Swaps.

Currently operational infrastructure + Progress:

[1] CryptoID block explorer - This was restored, along with correct labels for burn addresses: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/pot/#; 
[2] SPV infrastructure - This includes ElectrumX server - This is being worked on, and will be added to AtomicDEX when done.

Project updates?
----------------
As we explore various components of Potcoin code, including its current status, we will be updating folks.
We are working with the Potcoin team leadership to coordinate these efforts and to ensure seamless integration / re-integration 
of the Potcoin UTXO chain into the overall DeFi environment.
